How Can I Contribute?


Reporting Bugs
	1.	Search Existing Issues
Before creating a new issue, please check the Issues page to ensure the bug hasn’t already been reported.
	2.	Create a New Issue
If you find a bug not listed, open a new issue and provide a clear, detailed description. Include:
	•	Steps to reproduce the problem
	•	Expected behavior
	•	Actual behavior
	•	Error messages or logs (if any)
	3.	Label Appropriately
When possible, add appropriate labels (e.g., bug) to help categorize the issue.


Suggesting Features
	1.	Check for Similar Suggestions
Look at the Issues page to see if a feature request already exists.
	2.	Open a New Feature Request
If your idea is new, please open a feature request issue describing:
	•	The use case for the feature
	•	How it would improve the project
	•	Any relevant technical details or potential solutions


Improving Documentation
	•	Typos, Clarifications, and Enhancements
If you notice unclear sections, typos, or missing information in the documentation or README, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with your improvements.


Contributing Code
	1.	Pick an Issue
Look through the Issues tagged with help wanted or good first issue to find something you can work on.
	2.	Discuss Your Plan
Comment on the issue to let others know you’re interested in resolving it. Wait for feedback before making extensive changes.
	3.	Fork the Repository
Create a personal fork of the repository to work on the changes in your own environment.
	4.	Create a Feature Branch


git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name




	5.	Implement Your Changes
	•	Follow our Coding Guidelines.
	•	Add or update unit tests if you introduce new features or fix bugs.
	6.	Commit and Push


git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name




	7.	Open a Pull Request (PR)
Go to your fork on GitHub and open a PR against this repository’s main (or relevant) branch. Provide a clear summary, referencing the issue number if applicable.


Project Setup
	1.	Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-cgi-library.git
cd cpp-cgi-library




	2.	Compile the Project
You can compile the library or example applications using a C++ compiler such as g++ or clang++. For example:


g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 -o ./cgi/main.cgi


	•	Make sure to include the CGI.h header in your source file(s).


	3.	Environment
	•	This library is designed for CGI environments.
	•	parse_post_data() uses std::cin for reading POST data.


Coding Guidelines


Code Style
	•	C++11 or Higher
Use modern C++ features where appropriate (e.g., auto, range-based for loops).
	•	Standard Library
Favor standard library data structures and algorithms where possible.
	•	Naming Conventions
	•	Classes and structs: CamelCase (e.g., CGI, SessionManager)
	•	Variables and functions: snake_case (e.g., parse_query_string(), post_data_map)
	•	Exception Safety
Ensure that your contributions handle exceptions or potential errors gracefully.


Commit Messages
	•	Use clear, concise descriptions of the changes made.
	•	Reference issues when relevant by adding Fixes #<issue_number> or Closes #<issue_number>.


Pull Request Guidelines
	1.	One Feature/Bug Fix per Pull Request
This makes it easier to review and merge changes.
	2.	Include Tests
	•	If you add or modify functionality, consider adding or updating existing tests.
	•	Verify that all tests pass before opening a PR.
	3.	Descriptive Title and Description
Provide a brief summary of the changes in your pull request title. In the description, explain the reasoning behind your changes and include references to related issues if applicable.
	4.	Code Review
Your pull request may receive feedback or requests for changes. Please address these promptly.


Testing
	•	Unit Tests
While this project may not have an extensive testing framework in place yet, we encourage contributors to include small test programs or unit tests (e.g., using Google Test, Catch2, or similar) to verify new functionality.
	•	Manual Tests
Since this is a CGI library, some testing will require a CGI-capable web server or environment (e.g., Apache, Nginx with CGI enabled, or local testing tools). Verify:
	•	GET/POST parameter parsing
	•	Session ID generation and retrieval
	•	Edge cases (e.g., missing parameters)


Code of Conduct


Please note that this project adheres to a simple and respectful Code of Conduct (if one is provided). By participating, you agree to maintain a welcoming environment for all contributors.


License


By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same MIT License that covers this repository. For more information, see the LICENSE file.


Thank you for helping to improve the C++ CGI Library! We appreciate your time and effort. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or reach out to the project maintainers.
